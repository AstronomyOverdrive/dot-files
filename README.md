# My personal dotfiles
**Hear ye, hear ye!**  
Now *I use <del>Arch</del> Artix btw* but I also (at the time of writing) use Gentoo, Debian & OpenBSD and therefor I use these files more as a base to speed up the setup of new systems rather than them being an exact copy of my current system so expect having to tweak them to fit your system and needs if you use them.<br>
*This also means certain files may be outdated.*<br><br>
  
This repo is public in case you want to use it for inspiration but don't expect any help from me if you run into issues as it's mostly uploaded here for my own convenience!<br>
The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) and [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/) might be useful though.
